# Final Project - Introduction to Chaos
Repository with files and documents containing necessary code for the final project in the course "Introduction To Chaos Applied To Systems, Processes And Products". The documents contain the necessary code to draw the figures detailed in the scientific paper: "Unusual dynamics of extinction in a simple ecological model" by Sinha & Parthasarathy.

## How to Use
The document *ricker_model_functions.R* contains the functions which all other files in this project depend on, therefore, it is advised to either:
- Download all the files together as a .zip file and load them into R Studio on one project workspace, because every file has a function to load all of the necessary functions from the *ricker_model_functions.R* document

or
- Download all of the files together and then first open the *ricker_model_functions.R* and run the script to load all the functions and then use all of the other files

All of the other instructions that are related to the code should be provided in the commentary in the code itself.

This code and project were made by Tauras Paknys and Borna Šeatović, students of the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería y Diseño Industrial during their Erasmus summer semester 2025.
